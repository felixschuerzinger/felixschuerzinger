## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student at the laboratoire MAP5, UniversitÃ© Paris CitÃ©.

I currently work on nonparametric estimation for stochastic differential equations.

Right now, I am studying a least-squares projection estimator for an integral transform of the transition density of a stochastic differential equation.
This github gathers the simulation work connected to my mathematics research.

I am also passionate about econometrics, specifically option pricing and market dynamics along with their mathematical backgrounds.

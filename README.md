## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student at the MAP5, UniversitÃ© Paris CitÃ©.

I am working on nonparametric estimation for stochastic differential equations.

Right now, I am studying a least-squares projection estimator for an integral transform of the transition density of a stochastic differential equation.
